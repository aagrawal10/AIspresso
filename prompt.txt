This is a personal catchup dashboard to catchup from hn, reddit and twitter. Although I have configured the secrets in .env.local, only HN works and rest are not working. Someone told me this

"In a Next.js application, I have a client-side component (`page.tsx`) that registers `FeedFetcherInterface` implementations for Reddit and Twitter. These fetchers (`RedditFetcher.ts` and `TwitterFetcher.ts`) rely on environment variables defined in `.env.local` (e.g., `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`).

The problem is that the application only detects the Hacker News feed, and not Reddit or Twitter, even after configuring the `.env.local` file and restarting the development server. The `page.tsx` explicitly registers all three fetchers.

The issue likely stems from Next.js's default behavior where environment variables are server-side only unless prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. The fetcher classes are attempting to access these variables directly without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix on the client-side.

How can I correctly expose and access these environment variables on the client-side for `RedditFetcher.ts` and `TwitterFetcher.ts` to ensure all feeds are configured?"

Can you fix this?
