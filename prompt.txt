### âœ… Prompt: *Personal Catch-Up Dashboard for Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter (and More)*

> I want to build a **personal content dashboard** that shows me **only the new posts I havenâ€™t seen yet** from:
>
> * ðŸŸ§ **Hacker News** â€” top stories from the front page
> * ðŸ”´ **Reddit** â€” posts from **communities and users I follow**, as if I visited my Reddit home feed
> * ðŸ”µ **Twitter** â€” tweets from **one or more of my Twitter Lists**, personalized to my account

### ðŸ’¡ Key Behavior & UX Goals:

* Show **only new content**, sorted by **recency**
* Track **"last seen"** timestamp or post ID per source
* Stop rendering once Iâ€™ve caught up â€” show a clear **"âœ… Youâ€™re all caught up"** message
* Use **official embed SDKs** where available (Reddit, Twitter, YouTube)
* Use **minimal styled cards** to mimic UI for sources without embeds (e.g., Hacker News)
* Store `lastSeen` state in **localStorage** (single-user for now)

---

### ðŸ”Œ Extensibility Requirements:

This system should be designed to support **easy addition of new sources** later, with minimal backend/frontend changes.

* Support for **YouTube** is a priority â€” once I follow the right channels, I want to:

  * Pull latest videos from subscribed channels
  * Embed them directly using YouTubeâ€™s embed system

* Future source types may include:

  * **ArXiv** (via RSS) for research papers
  * **GitHub trending repos**
  * **Substack or blog RSS feeds**
  * **PapersWithCode**
  * **Hugging Face, OpenAI, Meta AI, etc.**

Each new source should fit into a unified system with:

* A common `Post` data model
* A pluggable feed parser
* A way to track `lastSeen` or `lastFetched`
* Optionally: source-specific filters (e.g. followed users, tags)

This is a new repo, so setup whatever you want to. Let me know what I need to provide to run it, some API keys? Need to do some oauth?

Note: This is a personal project and not something to share with others for now, so just build a fully functional MVP accordingly
